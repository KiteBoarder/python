## function overloading:
Python doesn't support function overloading.  
When we define multiple functions with the same name, the later one always overrides the prior and thus, in the namespace, there will always be a single entry against each function name.


## for loop: 
```
for i, number in enumerate(numbers):
    print(i * 2, number)
    
```
